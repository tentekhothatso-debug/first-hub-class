# TessBevs is a company that sells beverages!

* The hero section uploaded consists of a navigation bar, pictures, headings, paragraph, button, social media icons from React icons, and also consists of cards.

* i chose bright and dramatic colors for my Hero section because i realized during the process of its development that i'm a very dramatic and a happy person at all times, so i decided to go with that  combination of colors to represent my personality. 

* _THE BUTTONS, NAVLINKS, SOCIAL ICONS AND THE HAMBURGER ICON_ **do not work**, It is the challenge that i encountered and i slightly failed to conquer, but im working on fixing them. 
* Through this project, i learned a lot about Tailwindcss. From its installation to its implementation, all of the styling in my project is done by Tailwindcss


* To run the code, i run " npm run dev" command in the terminal and open the local host link to see the project
